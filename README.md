# AI-Driven Interview System
An AI-driven interview system designed to automate and optimize the hiring process. The system evaluates candidate responses, providing unbiased and consistent scoring based on predefined ideal answers, reducing manual HR efforts, and speeding up the hiring workflow.

# Problem Statement
The traditional hiring process can be time-consuming and inefficient, with manual screening of resumes and subjective evaluation of candidate interviews. Our system aims to:

Automate candidate assessments.
Ensure unbiased, consistent, and objective evaluation.
Save valuable time and resources for HR teams by eliminating manual interview reviews.
Features
AI-Powered Interviews: The system conducts interviews by asking predefined questions and evaluates responses using natural language processing (NLP) and keyword matching.
Automated Scoring: AI compares candidate answers to ideal responses and provides a score based on relevance and accuracy.
Consistency & Fairness: All candidates are evaluated by the same criteria, ensuring unbiased assessments.
Time-Saving: Speeds up the hiring process by automating initial interviews and evaluations.
Scalability: Can handle a large volume of candidate interviews simultaneously, making it suitable for organizations of all sizes.
How It Works
Interview Flow:
AI conducts interviews by asking predefined questions related to the job role.
Candidates provide responses (text or speech).
AI analyzes responses using NLP models and compares them to ideal answers.
The system scores the candidate's response based on keyword matching and contextual understanding.
Evaluation Process:
The candidate's answer is evaluated on relevance, clarity, and alignment with ideal answers.
NLP techniques like TF-IDF or BERT are used for semantic understanding and keyword extraction.
